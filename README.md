It is a native iOS Application that allows us to build a diary of our trip. It will help us mark and record the   places we went along with a  small description and picture of the place we visited. There are other similar applications like  Diary, Instagram & Facebook.  However, My Trip is mainly based on one’s trip details, hence provides more richer and a compelling user experience�
